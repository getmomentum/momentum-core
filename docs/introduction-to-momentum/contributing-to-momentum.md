# Contributing to momentum

We welcome and deeply appreciate any contributions to momentum. No matter how small, every contribution is valuable!

Contributions can be of the form: 
1. Documentation : Help improve our docs! If you fixed a problem, chances are others faced it too.
2. Code : Help us make improvements to existing features and build new features for momentum. 
3. Tests :  Help us make momentum resilient by contributing tests.

>Contributors should follow the [code of conduct](/docs/introduction-to-momentum/code_of_conduct.md)

When contributing to momentum, ensure that: 

1. You have looked at [open issues](https://github.com/getmomentum/momentum-core/issues) to see if there's something you can do for us.
2. If there is a major feature you would like to work on that is not present on the issues page, before implementation [open an issue](https://github.com/getmomentum/momentum-core/issues/new) and discuss it with the core team.
4. Aim for 100% test coverage when contributing new features. Tests help verify your code and protect against future changes.
5. Ensure that all your changes run end to end locally, include screenshots of local test results wherever possible in your PR. 
6. Once the code is ready, raise a pull request towards the main repo for peer review and acceptance.



To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
